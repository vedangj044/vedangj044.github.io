# ![alien](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f47d.png) About me

Hi, I'm Vedang, a computer enthusiast and student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), with a passion for distributed systems - there's something incredibly cool about solving complex, large-scale challenges. My journey into tech really took off during a two-year stint on the cybersecurity team at Innovaccer, a late-stage startup. I call it an "unfair advantage" because I had the opportunity to dive deep into all three major cloud providers, automate processes, build web applications, and develop a strong foundation in security-all while having a blast.

That experience sparked my interest in scalable, distributed systems, where I could combine technical depth with my desire to solve meaningful, impactful problems. I'm always full of energy, self-taught, and constantly looking for new things to learn. Whether it's hacking away at a new project or learning the latest tech, I'm eager to dive in and push the limits.
<br/>
<br/>
When I'm not programming, you'll probably find me immersed in a good book or vibing to music. I also have a knack for DIY projects - building things from scratch has been my first love for as long as I can remember. Whether it's crafting something new or tinkering with gadgets, I'm always looking for creative outlets. And of course, I love chatting about the latest trends in tech - there's always something exciting happening!

Over the last two years, I've spent my days working with <u>AWS</u> and <u>Azure</u>, where I was the main person behind an in-house security solution that had a huge impact. I took this project from designing it, to building it, to keeping it running smoothly as it grew. For the same project, I integrated tools like <u>Snowflake</u>, <u>Databricks</u>, and <u>New Relic</u>, connecting everything with cron jobs, <u>Python FastAPI</u>, and a <u>React</u> frontend. I also got hands-on with CI/CD pipelines and <u>Kubernetes</u>. One of my proudest achievements was building a <u>Terraform</u> module that's deployed every time a new customer comes on board. It uses StackRox (now Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security) for protecting clusters, and I managed our own StackRox setup as if it were my own little garden.
<br/>
<br/>
In our team, I became the go-to person for fixing Snowflake connectivity issues. We had layers of security in our Snowflake setup, and I was one of the few who really understood how each piece worked. So whenever someone hit a connection problem, they'd come straight to me. I also took care of managing Satori Cyber clusters, handling updates, scaling, and monitoring them like I was growing a plant—always keeping an eye on their health.
<br/>
<br/>
I've also had the chance to do a lot of internships throughout college, and I credit internships and hackathons for a lot of my learning. I participated in Google Summer of Code, where I teamed up with some awesome Red Hat engineers to build an IoT-as-a-Service solution in Rust, which was a great learning experience.
<br/>
<br/>
I've interned twice at Innovaccer—once working on a schema API that let you change database definitions through a REST API, and another time building automations to simulate DOS attacks and run Nmap scans on open ports. On top of that, I even tried my hand at Android development, spending four months working with Kotlin and CameraX, and had a great time doing it.
<br/>
<br/>
All these experiences across different areas of tech have been amazing, but what excites me the most is diving deep into distributed systems. I'm eager to build and scale software that can solve real-world problems and reach people around the globe.

<hr/>
Some of the projects I built during college.

- [Paradigm](https://github.com/Paradigm-shift-AI), is an automated testing tool. It is a plugin that converts whatever is taught in an online class to True/False and Fill in the blanks question and sends them to the students' smartphone in real-time. This helps improve attentiveness and retention in students. [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceVBPfb-jlc)
- [Famulus](https://github.com/vedangj044/News_stock_prediction), is an intelligent stock prediction tool. The users input a keyword, this tool analyses all the latest news articles to predict the change in the value of this stock in an interval of 1, 5, 7, 15 days. [Read more](https://vedangj044.github.io/blog/famulus/)
- [Frisson](https://github.com/vedangj044/Frisson), is a very simple android app to read stories about UFO sightings. It was built with Kotlin, following all aspects of MAD aka Modern Android Development.
- [Music Wall](https://github.com/vedangj044/MusicWallProject), is a Web App, it creates a beautiful Music wall webpage for you, whenever you like a music video, it is added to this page, thus you can share your music interests with friends.
- Assistant, is a script that adds voice commands to simple tasks. It uses IFTT and thus works with Google Assistant, Alexa, or even automatic.

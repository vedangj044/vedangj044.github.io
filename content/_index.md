# ![alien](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f47d.png) About me

I am currently a college student. I am fond of programming and building DIY stuff with Arduino and ESPes. I have been tinkering with DIY electronics since the age of 12. I am also an open source contributor and I believe in open source. Other than open source, I am zealous about hackathons. I have participated in many hackathons with my team Blueprint and also won at a few. I spend my day in front of the computer learning something new. I am also a part of many open communities in my city. Attending meetups and talks energizes me. I have also arranged and spoken at some meetups as I enjoy public speaking.
<br/>
<br/>
While I am not programming. I enjoy reading books, spending time with my friends, and vibing to music. I am driven by creativity and optimization.

I started with programming Arduino, then I moved to Python. I love Flask, Django, and FastAPI which is my go-to stack for Web development and I have worked with javascript and React, but I have realized I don't enjoy front-end and UI much. I have also build Android apps and worked as an Intern Android Developer. I like Java for its verbosity but only when used in Android studio. Soon, I switched to Kotlin for Android apps because all cool things in the Android world happen in Kotlin lately. The Newest addition to my tool-set is Rust. I have enjoyed it very much.

<br/>
I use Azure for learning and experimentation. I have done many Qiwiklabs for GCP as well. I use Docker in my projects. I also have a working knowledge of Kubernetes.
